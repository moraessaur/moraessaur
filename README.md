# **Hello, welcome to my github page :)**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Lucas, I am a data scientist from Brazil. I have an academic background in genetics (bioinformatics), but have experience working in several different initiatives, not exclusive to life sciences.

I have been using R, Python and data science tools since way back, when I began my [research using bayesian inference](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028297) in 2009.

A little bit of what I have been up to in recent years:

-   Currently I am a data scientist at [Melhor Envio](https://melhorenvio.com.br/). Here I work mainly with data driven metric enhancement, client segmentation and storytelling.

-   Before that I spent a couple of years doing freelance work helping people clean their data, run their analyses, process the outcome and wrap all up for publications or reports. This gave me some valuable soft skills (dealing with clients is an adventure).

-   As a "dual class" biologist and data scientist, I worked for five years at Brazil's National Centre for Flora Conservation. I did A LOT of different work here, which is hard to summarise. Probably my most important experience here was using data analysis to aid data driven decision making regarding threatened plant species. My R programming skills served in a "jack-of-all-trades" manner though.

-    I have a Bachelors and Masters degree from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), in genetics.

    -   The subject of the former was to understand spetiation events of Sotalia dolphins using molecular phylogenetics and bayesian inference.

    -   For the latter, I compiled data from different sources in order to understand the evolutionary relationships and distinctness of brazilian plant lineages.

    -   In both cases I relied heavily on computer programming and statistics.
