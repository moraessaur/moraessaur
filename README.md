**I am currently reshaping my github page and its projects. It has been hard to keep it all updated with how busy my life currently is.**

# **Hello, welcome to my github page :)**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Lucas, I am a data scientist from Brazil. I have an academic background in genetics (bioinformatics), but have experience working in several different initiatives, not exclusive to life sciences.

I have been using R, Python and data science tools since way back, when I began my [research using bayesian inference](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028297) in 2009.

A little bit of what I have been up to in recent years:

* Currently I am a data scientist at Carrefour. There I work mainly with supply forecasting for promotional events in stores across the country.
* Before that I have worked at PicPay (a brazilian fintech) and Melhor Envio (a company that mediates logistics for small and medium e-commerce entrepreneurs).
* In parallel I have been acting as an consultant to scientific projects, usually performing statistical analyses related to biological conservation projects. 

* I have a Bachelors and Masters degree from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), in genetics.
  * The subject of the former was to understand spetiation events of Sotalia dolphins using molecular phylogenetics and bayesian inference.
  * For the latter, I compiled data from different sources in order to understand the evolutionary relationships and distinctness of brazilian plant lineages.
  * In both cases I relied heavily on computer programming and statistics.
